## Contributing to GEPA-SPO

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome improvements, bug fixes, docs, and new strategies.

### Getting started

- Use pnpm: `pnpm install`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`
- Test: `pnpm test`

### Development guidelines

- Keep changes focused and small; write tests alongside code.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness; follow the existing code style and TypeScript strictness.
- Avoid adding dependencies unless there is a strong reason.
- Document public APIs with JSDoc and update the README if user-facing behavior changes.

### Commit and PR

- Use Conventional Commits, e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
- Open a PR against `main` with a clear description, risks, and test plan.
- Ensure CI (typecheck, lint if present, tests) passes.
