First, find the homogeneous solution by solving the characteristic equation. Then use the method of undetermined coefficients to find particular solutions for both non-homogeneous terms. Combine to get the general solution and apply initial conditions. Finally, evaluate x(π/2) and y(π/2) in exact form."
